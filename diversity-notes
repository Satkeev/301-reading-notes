Analysis
We sifted through the global employee data of several leading tech firms where available. 
The data isn’t exactly black and white: not all companies declare their figures and most 
don’t reveal the ratio of manual labourers to executives. But some interesting patterns 
arise and it’s clear that some are better represented than others.

Data Analysis 2016: Latest Figures
In the last 12 months, Facebook, Apple, eBay and Microsoft hired 1% more women. LinkedIn

n increased their female staff by 3%. Google’s gender ratio stayed the same.

Microsoft gained 3% non-white employees, Facebook 2%; while Google, Apple and eBay 
increased their non-white staff by 1%. LinkedIn lost 3% of its non-white employees.

Within the companies who expanded their ethnic diversity, Asian staff accounted for
the majority of the increase, while the ratio of Hispanic employees remained static.
Apple registered the biggest jump: 3% increase in Asian hires.

Silicon Valley’s gender gap is the result of computer-game marketing 20 years ago

It’s no secret that there is a pronounced gender gap in technology fields. In 2014, 
70% of the employees at the top tech companies in Silicon Valley, such as Google, 
Facebook, and Twitter, were male. In technical roles, this phenomenon is even more 
pronounced; for example, only 10% of the technical workforce at Twitter is female.

But things haven’t always been this way. The numbers of enrollments among men and 
women in computer science were on their way toward parity in the 1970s and early 1980s. 
In 1984, 37% of computer science graduates were women, but those numbers began to drop 
dramatically in the middle of the decade. By 2016, that number had been whittled down
to 18%. This dip in the 1980s has created a chasm that the past 30 years hasn’t been able
to overcome—and the dude-centric computer marketing campaigns of that time may be to blame.


Programming is fast becoming the most lucrative skill you can have in the modern world.
According to a recent study conducted by Glassdoor, 11 of the 25 best-paying jobs are
technology related, with an average earning potential of between $106,000 and $130,000
a year. And this trend is showing no signs of letting up: The Bureau of Labor Statistics
projects that employment of computer and information-technology occupations will grow
by 12% between 2014 and 2024, faster than the average for any other occupation.


However, women will not have the same access to the opportunities presented by this industry.
Many of these companies blame the pipeline, citing poor enrollment and graduation rates among
women in technology. And they have a point: In states like Mississippi, Montana, and Wyoming
not a single girl took an AP-level computer-science examination in 2014.

Marketing games
Although a whole host of factors played a role in this phenomena, Elizabeth Ames from the
Anita Borg Institute for Women in Technology believes that one of the primary reasons 
can be traced back to the close relationship between computing and gaming in the 1980s
. “A lot of early computers were used for game playing,” Ames says. “Those games tended
to be more aimed more at boys and men, so it was easy for boys to get a leg up in that
area through gaming.”

For example, the Apple personal computer that was released at the time was marketed 
specifically to boys (included them teasing girls’ computer skills), as were a whole 
range of other consoles. This gave rise to male computing culture. As a result, a 1985 
study reported that 73% of men used a computer on a weekly basis, compared to
45% of women surveyed.



This bias toward boys in advertising has a fascinating history in its own right. In 1983, the 
US experienced a video game recession. The market shrank from $3.2 billion in 1983 to 
$100 million in 1985, a drop of 97%. The crash was primarily brought about by low-quality games
flooding the market, which smothered consumer confidence. Subsequently, marketers trying to 
rebuild the industry sought to leverage the small audience they had left, which, according
to their research, was mostly boys.

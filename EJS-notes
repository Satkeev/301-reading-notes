### What is EJS?

What is the "E" for? "Embedded?" Could be. How about "Effective," "Elegant," or just "Easy"? 
EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.
No religiousness about how to organize things. No reinvention of iteration and control-flow.
\It's just plain JavaScript.

Use plain JavaScript
We love JavaScript. It's a totally friendly language. All templating languages grow to be 
\Turing-complete. Just cut out the middle-man, and use JS!

Fast development time
Don't waste time and attention figuring out arcane new syntax because 'elegance' — or how to
preprocess your data so it will actually render right.

Simple syntax
JavaScript code in simple, straightforward scriptlet tags. Just write JavaScript that emits 
the HTML you want, and get the job done!

Speedy execution
We all know how fast V8 and the other JavaScript runtimes have gotten. EJS caches the 
intermediate JS functions for fast execution.

Easy debugging
It's easy to debug EJS errors: your errors are plain JavaScript exceptions, with template 
line-numbers included.

Active development
EJS has a large community of active users, and the library is under active development. 
We're happy to answer your questions or give you help.
Install
It's easy to install EJS with NPM.

$ npm install ejs
Use
Pass EJS a template string and some data. BOOM, you've got some HTML.

let ejs = require('ejs');
let people = ['geddy', 'neil', 'alex'];
let html = ejs.render('<%= people.join(", "); %>', {people: people});
CLI
Feed it a template file and a data file, and specify an output file.

ejs ./template_file.ejs -f data_file.json -o ./output.html
Browser support
Download a browser build from the latest release, and use it in a script tag.

<script src="ejs.js"></script>
<script>
  let people = ['geddy', 'neil', 'alex'];
  let html = ejs.render('<%= people.join(", "); %>', {people: people});
</script>

Example
<% if (user) { %>
  <h2><%= user.name %></h2>
<% } %>
Usage
let template = ejs.compile(str, options);
template(data);
// => Rendered HTML string

ejs.render(str, data, options);
// => Rendered HTML string

ejs.renderFile(filename, data, options, function(err, str){
    // str => Rendered HTML string
});
Options
cache Compiled functions are cached, requires filename
filename Used by cache to key caches, and for includes
root Set project root for includes with an absolute path (e.g, /file.ejs). Can be array 
to try to resolve include from multiple directories.
views An array of paths to use when resolving includes with relative paths.
context Function execution context
compileDebug When false no debug instrumentation is compiled
client Returns standalone compiled function
delimiter
openDelimiter
closeDelimiter '/li>
debug Outputs generated function body
strict When set to `true`, generated function is in strict mode
_with Whether or not to use with() {} constructs. If false then the locals will be stored 
in the locals object. (Implies `--strict`)
localsName Name to use for the object storing local variables when not using with D
efaults to locals
rmWhitespace Remove all safe-to-remove whitespace, including leading and trailing whitespace. 
It also enables a safer version of -%> line slurping for all scriptlet tags (it does not strip
new lines of tags in the middle of a line).
escape The escaping function used with <%= construct. It is used in rendering and is
.toString()ed in the generation of client functions. (By default escapes XML).
outputFunctionName Set to a string (e.g., 'echo' or 'print') for a function to print output inside scriptlet tags.
async When true, EJS will use an async function for rendering. (Depends on async/await support in the JS runtime.
Tags
<% 'Scriptlet' tag, for control-flow, no output
<%_ ‘Whitespace Slurping’ Scriptlet tag, strips all whitespace before it
<%= Outputs the value into the template (HTML escaped)
<%- Outputs the unescaped value into the template
<%# Comment tag, no execution, no output
<%% Outputs a literal '<%'
%> Plain ending tag
-%> Trim-mode ('newline slurp') tag, trims following newline
_%> ‘Whitespace Slurping’ ending tag, removes all whitespace after it
Includes
Includes are relative to the template with the include call. (This requires the 'filename' option.) For example if you have "./views/users.ejs" and "./views/user/show.ejs" you would use <%- include('user/show'); %>.

You'll likely want to use the raw output tag (<%-) with your include to avoid double-escaping the HTML output.

<ul>
  <% users.forEach(function(user){ %>
    <%- include('user/show', {user: user}); %>
  <% }); %>
</ul>
CLI
EJS ships with a full-featured command-line interface. Options are similar to those used in JavaScript code:

cache Compiled functions are cached, requires filename
-o / --output-file FILE Write the rendered output to FILE rather than stdout.
-f / --data-file FILE Must be JSON-formatted. Use parsed input from FILE as data for rendering.
-i / --data-input STRING Must be JSON-formatted and URI-encoded. Use parsed input from STRING as data for rendering.
-m / --delimiter CHARACTER Use CHARACTER with angle brackets for open/close (defaults to %).
-p / --open-delimiter CHARACTER Use CHARACTER instead of left angle bracket to open.
-c / --close-delimiter CHARACTER Use CHARACTER instead of right angle bracket to close.
-s / --strict When set to `true`, generated function is in strict mode
-n / --no-with Use 'locals' object for vars rather than using `with` (implies --strict).
-l / --locals-name Name to use for the object storing local variables when not using `with`.
-w / --rm-whitespace Remove all safe-to-remove whitespace, including leading and trailing whitespace.
-d / --debug Outputs generated function body
-h / --help Display this help message.
-V/v / --version Display the EJS version.
Some examples of use:

$ ejs -p [ -c ] ./template_file.ejs -o ./output.html
$ ejs ./test/fixtures/user.ejs name=Lerxst
$ ejs -n -l _ ./some_template.ejs -f ./data_file.json

### jQuery 
offers a simple way to achieve a variety of common JavaScript tasks quickly and consistently, 
across all major browsers and without any fallback code needed. 
SELECT ELEMENTS PERFORM TASKS HANDLE EVENTS 
It is simpler to access jQuery's methods let you jQuery includes methods elements using jQuery
's update the DOM tree, that allow you to attach CSS-style selectors than it animate elements 
into event listeners to selected is using DOM queries. The and out of view, and loop elements 
without having selectors are also more through a set of elements, to write any tailback code
powerful and flexible. all in one line of code. to support older browsers. 

### LOOPING 
In plain JavaScript, if you wanted to do the same thing to several elements, you would need to
write code to loop through all of the elements you selected. 
c07/ js/ looping.js 
With jQuery, when a selector returns multiple elements, you can update all of them using the one 
method. There is no need to use a loop. 
$('li em') .addClass('seasonal '); $( 'li .hot') .addClass('favorite'); 
In this example, the first selector applies only to one element and the cl ass attribute's new value
triggers a CSS rule that adds a calendar icon to the left of it. 
The second selector applies to three elements. The new value added to the cl ass attribute for each
of these elements triggers a CSS rule that adds a heart icon on the right-hand side. 
The ability to update all of the elements in the jQuery selection is known as implicit iteration. 
When you want to get information from a series of elements, you can use the . each () method (which
you meet on p324) rather than writing a loop. 
e JQUERY 
In this code, the same value is added to the cl ass attribute for all of the elements that are found
using the selector. It doesn't matter if there are one or many. 

### GETTING ELEMENT CONTENT 
The • htm 1 () and • text () methods both retrieve and update the content of elements. This page wil
l focus on how to retrieve element content. To learn how to update element content, see p316 . 
. html() 
When this method is used to retrieve information from a jQuery selection, it retrieves only the HTML 
inside the first element in the matched set, along with any of its descendants. 
For example, $ (' u l ' ) • html () ; will return this: 
<li id="one"><em>fresh</em> figs</li> <l i id="two">pine nuts</li>
<li id="three">honey</li> <l i id="four">balsamic vinegar</l i> 
Whereas $ ( 'l i ') .html (); will return this: 
<em>fresh</em> figs 
Note how this returns only the content of the first <1 i> element. 
If you want to retrieve the value of every element. you can use the . each () method. 
JQUERY 
. text() 
When this method is used to retrieve the text from a jQuery selection, it returns the content from
every element in the jQuery selection, along with the text from any descendants. 
For example, $ ( ' u l ') . text (); will return this: 
fresh figs pine 

### UPDATING ELEMENTS 
Here are four methods that update the content of all elements in a jQuery selection . 
When the • htm 1 () and . text () methods are used as setters (to update content) they will replace
the content of each element in the matched set (along with any content and child elements). 
The . rep 1 aceWith () and . remove () methods replace and remove the elements they match (as well 
as their content and any child elements). 
The .html(),. text(), and . rep 1 aceWi th () methods can take a string as a parameter. The string
can: • Be stored in a variable • Contain markup 
When you add markup to the DOM, be sure to escape all untrusted content properly on the server. 
Both the . htm 1 () and • rep 1 aceWi th () methods carry the same security risks as using the 
DOM's i nnerHTML property. See p228 - p231 on XSS. 
@ JQUERY 
. html() 
This method gives every element in the matched set the same new content. The new content may include HTML. 
.replaceWith() 
This method replaces every element in a matched set with new content. It also returns the replaced elements. 
. text() 
This method gives every element in the matched set the same new text content. Any markup would be shown as text. 
. remove() 
This method removes all of t

When you add markup to the DOM, be sure to escape all untrusted content properly on the server. Both the
. htm 1 () and • rep 1 aceWi th () methods carry the same security risks as using the DOM's i nnerHTML property.

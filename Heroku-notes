### HEROKU

When installation completes, you can use the heroku command from your terminal.

On Windows, start the Command Prompt (cmd.exe) or Powershell to access the command shell.
Use the heroku login command to log in to the Heroku CLI:

## heroku login
heroku: Press any key to open up the browser to login or q to exit
 ›   Warning: If browser does not open, visit
 ›   https://cli-auth.heroku.com/auth/browser/***
heroku: Waiting for login...
Logging in... done
Logged in as me@example.com
This command opens your web browser to the Heroku login page. If your browser is already logged in
to Heroku, simply click the Log in button displayed on the page.
This authentication is required for both the heroku and git commands to work correctly.
To clone a local version of the sample application that you can then deploy to Heroku, execute the
following commands in your local command shell or terminal:

git clone https://github.com/heroku/node-js-getting-started.git
cd node-js-getting-started
You now have a functioning Git repository that contains a simple application as well as a package.json file, 
which isDeploy the app
In this step you will deploy the app to Heroku.

Create an app on Heroku, which prepares Heroku to receive your source code.

## heroku create
Creating sharp-rain-871... done, stack is heroku-18
http://sharp-rain-871.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/sharp-rain-871.git
Git remote heroku added
When you create an app, a git remote (called heroku) is also created and associated with your
local git repository.

Heroku generates a random name (in this case sharp-rain-871) for your app, or you can pass a
parameter to specify your own app name used by Node’s dependency manager.

View logs
Heroku treats logs as streams of time-ordered events aggregated from the output streams of all your app and Heroku components, providing a single channel for all of the events.

View information about your running app using one of the logging commands, heroku logs --tail:

## heroku logs --tail
